# Scott-Alston-Portfolio

[Check out my Page](https://salston77.github.io/Scott-Alston-Portfolio/)

This is a basic portfolio page at the moment. 
This project is built using the bootstrap library.
There are two JavaScript functions. First there is a function to collect the date and time, 
it is my hope if I continue with this project that I can use this to count the times the page is accessed.
Second, there is an onload function that loads 2 text fields and fades them in over separate time spans.
There is carousel that features a couple of projects I coded along with on an Udemy course. They do link
to my GitHub page, where they are hosted and able to play.
The contact field contains two hyperlinks, one to my email and the other to my GitHub home page.
